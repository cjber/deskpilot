# Changelog

What changed in each release, in the terms someone using deskpilot would notice. Dates are UTC.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Each version's entry is also its GitHub release notes.

## [Unreleased]

- **Clicks keep your keyboard focus.** A click or scroll no longer focuses or raises the target window while it runs,
  so keys you type meanwhile stay in your own window. An XWayland app that asks to be activated when clicked is not
  given focus while deskpilot acts on it.
- **Agents can act at the same time.** Clicks, scrolls and keys from several callers queue and run in turn instead of
  failing with `busy`. Up to 32 wait at once; past that an action is refused with a clear error.
- **Typed text arrives whole.** `deskpilot type` and the MCP `type_text` send the text as one action, so another
  agent's keys never land in the middle of it, and long text works. `--delay` now sets how long each key is held as
  well as the gap before the next.
- **Typing leaves your window alone.** Keys go only to the target app, so the window you are using no longer sees
  its keyboard focus leave and return, and its pointer no longer flickers while an agent types.
- **Scrolling ignores your compositor settings.** A scroll reaches the app as plain wheel notches, without your
  Hyprland mouse binds or scroll factors acting on it.
- **Clicks check what is on top before every press.** Each press and wheel notch asks Hyprland what is at the point,
  so a window, bar or popup that appears mid-click is refused instead of clicked.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-09

- **Clicks that leave your pointer alone.** `deskpilot click`, `scroll` and keys sent with `--window` run inside
  Hyprland through the deskpilot plugin: your pointer and keyboard focus go back where they were, and any mouse
  motion you made meanwhile is applied. Native Wayland, XWayland and Wine windows all receive a real click.
- **Screenshot coordinates.** `deskpilot shot` saves a window's screenshot and remembers its scale, so `click`,
  `move` and `scroll` take a point straight from the image. A point outside the window, or under another window, is
  refused.
- **No guessed windows.** A window is named by address, class, or part of its class or title, and a name that
  matches several windows is an error listing them.
- **Typing.** `deskpilot type` and `deskpilot key` type US-layout text and chords. `--delay` spaces keys for games,
  which read input once per frame.
- **Taking over when an app needs it.** `--take-pointer` and `--take-focus` move your own pointer or focus and press
  through a virtual input device, for a hover the app must see or an app that ignores keys while unfocused.
- **An agent cursor.** With `cua-driver` installed, an overlay arrow glides to each point deskpilot acts on.
- **Plugin management.** `deskpilot plugin load` builds the plugin for the running Hyprland and loads it; run it
  again after each Hyprland upgrade.
- **MCP server.** `deskpilot mcp` serves the same actions over stdio, keeping one input device and one agent cursor
  open for the session.
- **Works with Hyprland 0.57 and older.** Each dispatcher tries the Lua form first and falls back to the string
  form, and a shell with a stale `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` reaches the one live Hyprland.
